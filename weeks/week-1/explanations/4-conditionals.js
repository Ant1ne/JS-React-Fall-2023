// Intro to JS Conditionals

// What are Conditionals:
// In JavaScript, conditionals are like decision-making tools for your code. They help your program decide what to do based on certain conditions. Just like making choices in real life, conditionals guide your code down different paths depending on what's happening.

// Why Use Conditionals:
// Conditionals are essential because they make your code smarter and more adaptable. They allow your program to respond to different situations dynamically, providing a personalized experience for users. Without conditionals, your code would follow the same instructions regardless of what's going on, which isn't always helpful.

// How Conditionals Work:
// Conditionals have 3 different approaches within JS
// - If Statements
// - Switch Case Statement
// - Ternary Operators

// IF Statements

// An if statement checks if something is true or false. If it's true, your code follows one set of instructions; if it's false, your code follows a different set. This helps your program make choices and react accordingly.

// We can use:
// if- Executes code if a condition is true.
// else - Executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another if it's false.
// else if -  Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the first block of code where the condition is true.

// Examples

// Example 03 - Using a simple condition with a number and multiple conditions
// Let's say you're building a game where players earn points. You want to reward them differently based on their score.

let score = 45;

// Nested Conditionals
// You can also put conditionals inside other conditionals. This helps your code make more complex decisions.

// Example 01
let isHungry = true;
let hasMoney = false;

console.log(isHungry);
